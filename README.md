# (sw_pjv) Semester work on the subject of programming in Java
## Semester work

Part of the student's assessment can be semester work. Students should start thinking up assignments as early as the second week of the semester. Consult the assignment right from the end of the semester with your trainer.

## Requisites of work
The thesis should demonstrate, in addition to the creativity of the student, his ability to object design and the use of at least three of these technological units:

<ol>
  <li>graphical user interface (Java FX),</li>
  <li>database,</li>
  <li>collection,</li>
  <li>networking,</li>
  <li>multithreaded applications,</li>
  <li>AI.</li>
</ol>

An example would be a space shooter for two players with aliens controlled by artificial intelligence.
